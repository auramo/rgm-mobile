RGM Mobile
==========

To test this you'll have to edit your own DropBox API key and secret into RgmLoginDetailRepository.prototype.getStoredLoginDetails (credentials.js). After that you'll be able to test the app in the browser via index.html. 

To run it on android you'll have to install cordova and then run:

    cordova run android

while your phone is plugged in via USB and debug mode is enabled.
